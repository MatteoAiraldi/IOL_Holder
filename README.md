# IOL_Holder

This is the main repository for the IOL Holder project.
The IOL Holder is a 3D printable device that can be used to fixate a intraocular lens (IOL) to a smartphone for ocular surface imaging.

A detailed description of the clinical use of the IOL Holder can be found in __DOI__

Collaborators are welcome to edit and upload the 3D model files to adapt the IOL Holder to different smartphones.
The IOL Holder has been originally developed for an iPhone 11 Pro smartphone.

The files that can be found in the repository are:

1. **IOL_holder.stl.glb**: The main part of the device, with flanges to dock it on the smartphone and a well for the IOL that has to be positioned in front of the smartphone's camera.
2. **cap.stl.glb**: A screw down cap to hold the IOL in place.
